## Known issues

1. In some instances, the application may not generate the world as expected. Although the chunk logic is correct and functions properly under normal circumstances, this issue occasionally occurs for reasons that are currently unclear. If this happens, please relaunch the application to resolve the issue.<br>
2. The foliage, specifically the trees, does not generate leaves at all. This is because the logic for leaf generation has not been implemented. As a result, only the trunks are generated. Further development is needed to include the functionality for generating leaves.<br>
