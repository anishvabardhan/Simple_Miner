Starship Gold:

How To Use: -

The game executable is named Starship_Release_x64.exe. It can be found in the Run folder of the Starship project. If you want to run the solution file , it should be configured to Release and x64.
The different ways the game can be interacted with: -

1. To play the game, we control the player ship. To control the player ship, we press the E key or the left joystick on the xbox controller to give it a thrust and to turn it, we press the S and F keys or the left joystick on the controller.

2. To fire bullets we either use the SPACEBAR key or the A button on the controller.

3. To pause the game, we press the P key.

4. To update a single frame, press the O key.

5. To watch the game in slow motion, hold down the T key.

6. To go back to the main menu, press the ESC key or the B button on the controller.

Known Issues: -

1. There might come a scenario where the debris may stop spawning. I realised that the max amount of debris I was setting could have been less than my game needed, so I increased the amount of debris. But there could still come a situation where the debris is not rendered. I will hopefully make a better debris system in the future for other games.

2. There can also be situations where the audio is not working properly for entity explosions.

Deep Learning: -

Through the development of this engine and starship I learned a different way approaching development. Before coming to guildhall and working on starship, I had written a small scale game engine in opengl. My way of approaching the development of my engine was to first build a new engine feature and then find a way to test it. In hindsight, I realize that that was not a very good way of development. Through starship I understood that first defining what feature needs to be used and then expanding the engine around it is the way to go.

While developing engine, I struggled a lot with understanding the math and logic behind certain mathematical operations, same with visualising a lot of the polygon drawing. I used to try to figure them out mentally and visualised them in my head. But through this assignment, peer advices and a lot of guidance that Prof. Eiserloh gave us in class, I started drawing and writing down my approach to solutions physically using a pen and paper. This really improved my iterative process and i am now able to figure out problems mauch more effectively.

One thing I realise I went overboard with, is that I was just so excited at the start of the course to learn and start writing code, I did not really pace myself. I was just working so much on the engine and starship and trying to learn as much as I could because i was just happy to learn it, that I did not take care of my mental well-being. By the end of Starship Gold, I can confidently say that I have been extremely burnt out. I dont want to go through this again, but I'm sure I will. The only thing I can do is make sure this happens to me as less as possible. And to do that I will pace myself in the coming assigments and work that I do.
